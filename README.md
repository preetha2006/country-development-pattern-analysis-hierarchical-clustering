## Overview

This project analyzes development patterns among countries using **Hierarchical Clustering**. The objective is to group countries with similar socio-economic and demographic characteristics to understand global development trends.

## Dataset

The project uses a dataset containing country-level indicators such as income, life expectancy, child mortality, fertility rate, and GDP per capita.

## Approach

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature scaling
- Applying hierarchical clustering techniques
- Visualizing clusters using dendrograms

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Purpose

This project is developed for academic and analytical purposes to demonstrate unsupervised learning and clustering techniques in socio-economic data analysis.
